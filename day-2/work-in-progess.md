# Work in progess

The Day 2 content is still work in progress to convert from the old format (Powerpoint) to GitBook format. The main advantage of GitBook for the students is that copy-paste works much better. The main advantages for myself is easier styling of code boxes, and that it is easier to keep up to date.

Until this section is finished, you can look in the [note-pdf-and-pptx-variants.md](../prequel/notes/note-pdf-and-pptx-variants.md "mention") chapter of the Prequel>Notes section and download the Day 2 PPTX from WLPC Phoenix'25.
