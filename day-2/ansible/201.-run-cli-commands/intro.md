# Intro

In this exercise we will write a playbook that runs a single command on our WLC

We will observe that the output of the CLI command is passed back to the playbook, and can be used in further tasks

For this exercise, the output will be used in a task that prints the result of the CLI command out to the terminal where you ran the playbook
