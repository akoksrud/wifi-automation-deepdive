# 164. Create variables

### Selectable variable

We will create a couple of variables that we can use in our dashboards. In this dashboard, we will have drop-down menus at the top of our dashboard to select which AP we want to see statistics for. Similar variables can be created for WLCs, clients, switches, frequency bands, SD-WAN Managers, FTDs, etc.

Our variable will get all AP names and put them in a selectable list.

Go to Dashboard settings -> Variables and press <kbd>Add variable</kbd>&#x20;

Edit the name and Query sections:

For copy-paste, here is the text in the Query box:

```
SHOW TAG VALUES WITH KEY = "wtp_name"
```

Check if it is working in the bottom of the screeen:

1. Run query, check that <kbd>Preview of values</kbd> shows your AP
2. Press <kbd>Back to list</kbd> to get back to the Variables list

### Helper variable

We will also create a helper variable. That is a variable that will be used in the dashboards, but it will not be shown as a selection box. This is controlled through the "Hide" setting (marked 1. below).

1. Do not show the variable selection box on the dashboard
2. Enter the following text in the Query box:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sql
SELECT distinct("wtp_mac") FROM "Cisco-IOS-XE-wireless-access-point-oper:access-point-oper-data/ap-name-mac-map" WHERE ("wtp_name" =~ /^$APName$/)
```
{% endcode %}

Check if it is working in the bottom of the screen in the "Preview of values" section like you did on the first variable.&#x20;



Remember to save your dashboard in the top right corner of the screen.
