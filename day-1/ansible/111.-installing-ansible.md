# 111. Installing Ansible

We will now install Ansible into our virtual environment that we created in the [104.-create-virtual-environment.md](../preparations/104.-create-virtual-environment.md "mention") section.

Ensure you are in the virtual environment, and run the following command:

```
uv pip install ansible ansible-lint
```
