# 003. Testing Docker

In this section, we will test that Docker is installed correctly and that you can run some basic containers

First we run a Docker "Hello World" container. It will download automatically, and print "Hello from Docker!" if it is working correctly

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you get the following error message, it is because you didn't reboot after adding your user to the docker group in the [Installing Ubuntu Server](broken-reference) section. Go back and double check the steps if it doesn't work after a reboot.

Then you can try to run another image. Alpine Linux is a very slim Linux distro which is used as the base for a lot of containers. It requires about 8MB of disk space before adding other stuff.\
We will first pull (download) the container, then run it with the "-it" option which puts us into the shell of the container

```bash
docker pull alpine
docker run -it alpine
```

Run the container with the following command. When connected to the Alpine Linux container we can do regular Linux stuff, including installing apps using apk. As an example we will install nano, edit a text file and exit the container.

```bash
docker run -it alpine
```

You should now be ready for the Docker part of the deep dive
